# GoBackTester
This is a backtester written in Golang that uses forex data in order to backtest given trading strategies. Our Data is sourced from truefx.com's historical forex data and supported currencies are listed on their website.
> Update Dec 27, 2022: Parse through the HTML of TrueFX's website because they can't keep uniform links. Still need to test code.
